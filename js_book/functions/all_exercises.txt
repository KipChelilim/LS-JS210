 1: 1, `bar` on line 1 is a global variable. We then define a local variable on
    line 3 which is not used. Line 7 passes global variable `bar` to `log()`
    which outputs 1
 2: greeter.js
 3: multiply.js
 4: doesnt log anything, returns defined because of return w/o a value
 5: nothing, only returns a value
 6: the function arguments: 2, 3, & 4
    the function body: lines 2-3
    the function declaration: lines 1-4
    the function invocation: line 6
    the function name: multiplyNumbers
    the function parameters: num1, num2, num3
    the function return value: results or 24
    the names of all variables in this program:
      multiplyNumbers, num1, num2, num3, result, product

 7: 'Hello' and undefined
 8: 42 and 3.1415
 9: multiply, left, right, product, getNumber, prompt, parseFloat, question
    also console is a variable while log is a method of Console object which is
    not the global variable so this property is not a variable name
10: global: multiply, getNumber, left, right, console, parseFloat, question
    local: left, right, product, prompt
11: They are different; left and right used in lines 1-4 are parameters that get
    initialized as local variables for the function Lines 10 & 11 are global
    variables initialized on those lines.
