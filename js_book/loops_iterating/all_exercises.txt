3: First, the while condition is an assignment expression, so in each loop
   counter resets to 1. Second, the break condition on line 7 is when counter is
   greater than 2, which can't happen because we only increment counter by 1 on
   line 5. On every loop we fail the break condition (not greater than 2), and
   then reset counter back to 1.
4: No error, because the afterthought is optional. Code will output 1 - 5.
