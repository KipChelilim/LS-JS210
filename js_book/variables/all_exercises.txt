2: age.js
3: Should get an error since foo is not initialized in the outer scope
4: Should output three messages for Victor then give an error since you can't
   reassign a constant
5: Should log 'bar' since foo was initialized outside the block and is available
   on line 6. It doesn't output 'qux' because a second variable `foo` was
   initialized within the block and is unavailable outside of that block.
6: No, constants also have block scope so line 3 initializes a second variable
   named `FOO` which is not visible outside of the block.
